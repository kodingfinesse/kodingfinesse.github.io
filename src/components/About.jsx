    <p className="bio">Hello! I'm Darren Tran, a technology enthusiast and lifelong learner with a diverse professional background and a passion for innovation. My career journey has been unique and multidimensional, weaving through the fields of finance, customer service, and now tech. With a strong foundation in management and economics, I've learned to leverage my diverse experiences to excel in different environments.</p>
    <p className="bio">I began my career at LPL Financial as an Operations Specialist, where I led two process improvement projects that increased departmental productivity by over 200% and 300%. This experience honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, which I further developed as an Associate Accountant at Kaiser Permanente, where I handled complex payment processes and generated management reports to streamline operations.</p>
    <p className="bio">Seeking to expand my knowledge and capabilities, I pursued a Master of Management Studies at Duke University, The Fuqua School of Business, where I learned to navigate the complexities of modern business, combining strategic thinking with a passion for innovation. These experiences motivated me to pivot into the tech industry, where I could merge my technical skills with my business acumen.</p>
    <p className="bio">My transition into tech began with an apprenticeship as an IT Support Technician, where I developed a strong foundation in server administration, user account management, and network configuration. I learned to troubleshoot hardware and software issues and provide effective on-site support. Following this, I worked as a Full Stack Developer at Kenai's House, collaborating with another developer to build a production-ready website. This experience allowed me to apply my knowledge of JavaScript, React, and responsive web design, and I discovered a love for creating seamless, user-friendly digital experiences.</p>
    <p className="bio">My journey has taught me the value of adaptability, continuous learning, and a growth mindset. I am dedicated to combining my technical knowledge with my background in management to help organizations innovate, improve processes, and achieve their strategic goals. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can use my skills in both tech and business to drive meaningful impact.</p>
    <p className="bio">Currently, I am seeking opportunities to bring my diverse skill set to a forward-thinking organization that values innovation and growth. I am eager to contribute to projects involving cloud computing, data management, and IT support while continuing to expand my knowledge and expertise in these areas.</p>
